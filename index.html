        This arcade website showed a few games that I think are mildly fun as time
        killers and were excellent projects to brush-up on Javascript.

        In terms of design choices, I chose to stick to a purple and yellow color
        scheme since the colors are complementary. Additionally, the colors are kept
        light and low contrast to keep them easy on the eyes. The homepage is a simple
        list of buttons for every game with icons representing what the games are.
        The page uses a unified fonr with Nunito Sans and was put in using Google
        Fonts.

        There are 4 games: Tic-Tac-Toe, Spacebar Slinger, Submarine Pipes, and Hangman

        Tic-Tac-Toe is self-expanatory, since most people have playeed it. Furthermore,
        the code was based on the code provided by Professor Posnett. There's some 
        extra features like pop-in animations for the moves and the CPU waiting a bit
        before doing a move. Furthermore, the CPU will either take a winning move or
        block a player's winning move when possible, but do random moves otherwise.

        Spacebar Slinger is a reaction speed test where the player has to press space
        when prompted before the CPU. The CPU also gets a better reaction speed the
        more the player wins and slower reaction the more they lose to adjust the 
        difficulty based on player-skill.

        Submarine Pipes is a reskinned version of the mobile game Flappy Bird. The
        game was implemented using Javascript canvas to allow for dynamic element
        positioning. The loop runs 60 times per second to match a monitor's refresh
        rate.

        Finally, Hangman is my open-source based game. The code was provided by an
        MIT licensed project on GitHub by simonjsuh. Some changes I had to make were
        removing the Bootstrap styling on the page and replacing it with my own. I
        also had to redraw the hangman visuals to match the colors of my website. The
        original version lacked clear variable names and comments, so I changed those
        to make the source-code more readable. The page also used floats instead of
        flexbox, so I changed that to be up to modern CSS standards.

        Some challenges I faced were figuring out my own CPU behavior for tic-tac-toe.
        I wanted the game to be medium level difficulty, and I think my version is a 
        good compromise between always winning and randomness. Spacebar Slinger required
        some game state tracking and looping in order to make it keep running without
        extra user input. Submarine Pipes required a whole different paradigm with JS
        canvas, as elements needed to be positioned without the DOM. And Hangman required
        some time to set with poorly-documented source code to make it readable and
        workable with my project.
